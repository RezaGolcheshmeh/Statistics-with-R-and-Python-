# chapter1: Descriptive statistics

In this chapter we will learn descriptive statistics.

## Measures of central tendency

**Measures of Central Tendency** are statistical values that represent the *center* or *typical value* of a data set. They help us understand the overall trend or “average” behavior of the data.

### Mode

The **mode** is the value(s) that appear **most frequently** in the dataset.

In R, the **`lsr`** package provides a simple and clean way to calculate the **mode**.

**Step 1:** Install the `lsr` Package

```{r}
install.packages("lsr")
```

**Step 2:** Load the Package

```{r}
library(lsr)
```

Example

```{r}
data <- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5)
modeOf(data)
```

**⚠️ Important Note**

There is a **base R function** also named `mode()` — **but** it returns the **data type** (like `"numeric"`, `"character"`) instead of calculating the statistical mode!
