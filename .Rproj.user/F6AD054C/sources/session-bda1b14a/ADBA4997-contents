# chapter1: Descriptive statistics

In this chapter we will learn descriptive statistics.

## Measures of central tendency

**Measures of Central Tendency** are statistical values that represent the *center* or *typical value* of a data set. They help us understand the overall trend or “average” behavior of the data.

### Mode

The **mode** is the value(s) that appear **most frequently** in the dataset.

In R, the **`lsr`** package provides a simple and clean way to calculate the **mode**.

**Step 1**: Install the `lsr` Package

```{r}
install.packages("lsr")
```
